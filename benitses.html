      <p>Just a short distance from Corfu Town, Benitses is a small village that manages to meet every visitor’s need.
         The village stretches along the main road and offers both comfort and tranquility.
         Among Corfu’s tourist destinations, Benitses stands out for preserving the character of a traditional Greek village.
         You can still find old houses and fishermen in the small harbor, as well as ruins of a Roman villa and Roman baths.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">💡 Local Tips</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Locals will likely greet you when passing by and may even ask how Sonia (my mother) or Sophia (my sister) is doing – or if I’m around. Don’t be surprised if someone walks into the house just to say “Good morning!”</li>
        <li>You can park your car about 150 meters up the hill from the house, near the basketball court – the locals call that area “Drafo.”</li>
        <li>That’s also where the garbage collection point is – the municipality collects it daily.</li>
        <li>Don’t disturb the ducks.</li>
        <li>There’s a hiking trail after the house and beyond the basketball court. You can do a 4.5 km loop through the trees with stunning views over the village and sea. Best to go early in the morning to avoid the harsh sun, especially on the way back.</li>
        <li>Great coffee is available everywhere in the village.</li>
      </ul>
